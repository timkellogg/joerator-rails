This project is intended to make Rails development easier by providing a basic template with authentication/authorization, sass layouts, flash messages, and basic user functionality that should come with every app.  It is heavily based on the Rails Tutorial and eliminates the need to use Devise.

To get started, clone the repo.  Then you will need to reconfigure the name of the app by changing the default name in `config/application.rb` as well as the session_store in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`.  Also, you should change the database names in database.yml.  

Now you are ready to build an app without having to worry about configuring users!
